## HL7 AU FHIR Test Data
Sparked provides standard test data for AU Core and eRequesting. This standard test data set is for shared use, so it can only be updated by Sparked. 

### Test Data Properties
- The data contained in this repo is synthetic test data. 
- Synthetic data sets are representative of real-world data but not traceable to real entities. For example, real data supplied by industry partners has had some elements masked, and converted to FHIR format to generate synthetic test data for AU Core. 
- Synthetic data is used to replace privacy-sensitive information in testing environments, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. 
- The names contained are "production/real-like" in appearance but are not names of real people. 
- Any correspondence to the names of real people is entirely accidental.
- The addresses are valid addresses based on publicly available address data.
- GP and GP Practice data is either generated synthetic test data and/or based on publicly available data.

### Requests for Test Data
- If you want us to set up some test data that Sparked does not yet provide, let us know:
  - what test data you need;
  - which environments you need it in.
-  Raise the request or issue, e.g. missing data, as a GitHub issue or in Zulip.

### How to contribute Test Data
- TBD
